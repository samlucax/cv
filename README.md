## Professional experience

I help the team creating amazing e2e tests with the [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) framework and visual regression tests with [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) (for the web application), and UI Tests with XCUI Test (for the iOS app), and these tests are executed in our CI/CD server ([gocd](http://gocd.org)) for each pull request that is created, providing fast feedback after each change in the system. I'm also responsible for maintaining the mentioned CI/CD server and its infrastructure, with approximately 30 pipelines. I'm always learning new ways of doing my job better, and I'm a believer of agile, DevOps and lean methodologies.

#### Software developer and agile testing coach at [Taller Digital Business](http://taller.net.br/en/) (June 2014 – May 2016)
At first I was hired as QA to create automated acceptance tests in Gherkin format, but with some time I helped the company in a big transformation, where software test is not a phase during the software development process anymore, but part of it. In this transformation I changed my position to software developer, helping the team on developing features, and also as agile testing coach, sharing knowledge about agile testing through all the company and helping the team on building a mindset where everyone is responsible for the quality of the softwares developed.
At this position I worked firstly using Scrum, and then we evolve for using Kanban and a continuous flow.

At APD I worked in two different project (both as QA), but in the first we developed automated tests in Java (using Selenium), and in the 2nd we developed automated tests in VBScript (using QTP). Also, here I had my first contact with agile methodologies, such as Scrum. I was also lead of an internal project called Tech Talks.

_Stack:_ Java, VBScript and SQL.

#### Manual and automated test analyst at [Good Card](http://goodcard.com.br) (November 2009 - March 2011)
In this job I had my first contact with software test automation, having to make my manager understand that software test automation is not record and playback. At this company I started the creation of a test automation framework. Part of my job was also creating unit tests for triggers and procedures (since many business rules were in the database), creating and executing manual test cases and managing bugs. At this job I had also a small experience as software developer, writing PL/SQL code.
