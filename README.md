## Education
Bachelor in business management with an emphasis in system information analysis at PUCRS (2012)

## Professional experience
#### QA engineer at [Backbase](https://backbase.com) (April 2018 - current job)
I work in a Scrum team developing and maintaining front-end tests (using Protractor and Cucumber) and back-end tests (using Rest-Assured) for a micro-services architecture application. Other of my responsibilities are managing test environments, reviewing code, pair programming with back-end and front-end developers, and maintaining continuous integration pipelines (with Jenkins and GoCD).
I use to work remote occasionally and being productive working that way.

_Projects:_

- [Backbase Retail Banking](https://backbase.com/solutions/retail-banking/)

_Stack:_ NodeJS, Angular, AngularJS, Protractor, Cucumber, Java, Rest-Assured.

#### Senior QA engineer at [appear.in](http://appear.in) (June 2016 - February 2018)
I helped the team creating e2e tests with the [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) framework and visual regression tests with [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) (for the web application), and UI Tests with XCUI Test (for the iOS app), and these tests are executed in a CI/CD system ([gocd](http://gocd.org)) for each pull request that is created, providing fast feedback after each change in the system. I was also responsible for maintaining the previously mentioned CI/CD system and its infrastructure, with approximately 30 pipelines as code.
Every two months I was the on-call engineer, available 24/7 in case of production incidents, having to deal with things such as assessing the criticality of issues, accessing Linux servers and analyzing logs, analyzing git logs, working with monitoring tools like NewRelic, etc., in order to understand what was the issue and fixing it.
Last but not least, at appear.in I had the opportunity to work remotely and sometimes I think I produce even more when working this way when compared to going to the office.

_Projects:_

- [appear.in](https://appear.in)
- [appear.in (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appear.in-free-group-video/id878583078?mt=8)

_Stack:_ NodeJS, AngularJS, React, Protractor, Selenium Webdriver JS, BackstopJS, XCUI Test, AWS and Terraform.

#### Software developer and agile testing coach at [Taller Digital Business](http://taller.net.br/en/) (June 2014 – May 2016)
At first, I was hired as QA engineer to create automated acceptance tests in Gherkin format with Cucumber (in Ruby language), but with some time I helped the company in a big transformation, where software test is not a phase during the software development process anymore, but part of it. In this transformation I changed my position to a software developer, helping the team on developing features, and also as an agile testing coach, sharing knowledge about agile testing throughout all the company and helping the team on building a mindset where everyone is responsible for the quality of the software developed.
At this position, I worked firstly using Scrum, and then we evolved for using Kanban and a continuous flow.
I used to work remote and being productive working that way.

_Projects:_

- [Natura Relatório Anual](http://www.natura.com.br/relatorio-anual)
- [Natura Consumidor Final](http://www.natura.com.br/)

_Stack:_ Drupal, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SASS, Protractor, Cucumber and Vagrant.


#### QA at [ADP](https://www.adp.com) (April 2011 – May 2014)
At APD I worked in two different projects (both as QA analyst), but in the first one I developed automated tests in Java (using Selenium), and in the second one I developed automated tests in VBScript (using QTP). Also, here I had my first contact with agile methodologies, such as Scrum, and I was the leader of an internal project called Tech Talks.
I used to work remote occasionally and being productive working that way.

_Stack:_ Java, VBScript and SQL.

#### Manual and automated test analyst at [Good Card](http://goodcard.com.br) (November 2009 - March 2011)
In this job I had my first contact with software test automation, having to make my manager understand that software test automation is not about record and playback. At this company, I started the creation of a test automation framework for web applications. Part of my job was also creating unit tests for database triggers and procedures (since many business rules were in the database), creating and executing manual test cases and managing bugs. At this job I had also a small experience as software developer, writing PL/SQL code.

_Projects:_

- [Eco Benefícios](http://www.ecobeneficios.com.br/home)
- [Eco Frotas](https://www.ecofrotas.com.br/en/)

_Stack:_ Javascript and PL/SQL
