I'm a software engineer that loves testing, but I'm also a clean coder, blogger, YouTuber, writer, online teacher, mentor, speaker at conferences, an active member of technology communities and fan of good music, tattoos, and skateboarding.

## Education
Bachelor in business management with an emphasis in system information analysis at PUCRS (2012)

## Professional experience

### QA engineer at [Qelp](http://qelp.com) (June 2018 - current job)
I am working on defining a new software development process where quality is in our minds since the definition of the software requirements until the moment the software is already running in production. I am responsible for things like knowledge sharing sessions in things related to mindset, and technical stuff, such as how to create end-to-end tests, and visual regression tests. I'm also in charge of defining continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment pipelines to ensure we get quick feedback while changing the software. Some of the activities I do in my day-to-day are participating in architecture meetings, pair programming with software engineers and UX/UI designers, and defining user stories together with product owners. I use to work remote occasionally.

### Senior QA engineer at [appear.in](http://appear.in) (June 2016 - February 2018)
I helped the team creating end-to-end tests with the [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) framework and visual regression tests with [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) (for the web application), and UI Tests with XCUI Test (for the iOS app), and these tests were executed in a CI/CD system ([gocd](http://gocd.org)) for each created pull request, providing fast feedback changes in the system. I was also responsible for maintaining the previously mentioned CI/CD system and its infrastructure, with approximately 30 pipelines as code.
Every two months I was the on-call engineer, available 24/7 in case of production incidents, having to deal with things such as assessing the criticality of issues, accessing Linux servers and analyzing logs, analyzing git logs, working with monitoring tools like NewRelic, etc., in order to understand what was the issue and fixing it. I used to work remote occasionally.

_Projects:_

- [appear.in](https://appear.in)
- [appear.in (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appear.in-free-group-video/id878583078?mt=8)

_Stack:_ NodeJS, AngularJS, React, Protractor, Selenium Webdriver JS, BackstopJS, XCUI Test, AWS and Terraform.

### Software developer and agile testing coach at [Taller Digital Business](http://taller.net.br/en/) (June 2014 – May 2016)
At first, I was hired as QA engineer to create automated acceptance tests in Gherkin format with Cucumber (in Ruby language), but with some time I helped the company in a big transformation, where software test was not a phase during the software development process anymore, but part of it. In this transformation I changed my position to a software developer, helping the team on developing features, fixing bugs, performing refactoring, and also as an agile testing coach, sharing knowledge about agile testing throughout all the company, and helping the team on building a mindset where everyone is responsible for the quality of the software developed. At this position, I worked firstly using Scrum, and then we evolved for using Kanban and a continuous flow. I used to work remote occasionally.

_Stack:_ Drupal, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, SASS, Protractor, Cucumber and Vagrant.


### QA at [ADP](https://www.adp.com) (April 2011 – May 2014)
At APD I worked in two different projects (both as QA analyst), but in the first one I developed automated tests in Java (using Selenium), and in the second one I developed automated tests in VBScript (using QTP). Also, here I had my first contact with agile methodologies, such as Scrum, and I was the leader of an internal project called Tech Talks. I used to work remote occasionally.

_Stack:_ Java, VBScript and SQL.

### Manual and automated test analyst at [Good Card](http://goodcard.com.br) (November 2009 - March 2011)
In this job I had my first contact with software test automation, having to make my manager understand that software test automation is not about record and playback. At this company, I started the creation of a test automation framework for web applications. Part of my job was also creating unit tests for database triggers and procedures (since many business rules were in the database), creating and executing manual test cases, and managing bugs. At this job I had also a small experience as software developer, writing PL/SQL code.

_Projects:_

- [Eco Benefícios](http://www.ecobeneficios.com.br/home)
- [Eco Frotas](https://www.ecofrotas.com.br/en/)

_Stack:_ Javascript and PL/SQL

## Other projects and community contribution
